# N64 ðŸ’› Rust

This repo contains code for a talk given at the Melbourne Rust Meetup, on using Rust on the Nintendo 64. The examples demonstrate various ways that Rust can be used to program the Nintendo 64.

If you would like to see the slides from the talk, these can be found in [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf).

## Examples

1. [Old School C](#old-school-c)
2. [Calling Rust from C](#calling-rust-from-c)
3. [Booting from Rust](#booting-from-rust)
4. [Graphics in Rust](#graphics-in-rust)
5. [Libdragon in C](#libdragon-in-c)
6. [Libdragon in Rust](#libdragon-in-rust) - Incomplete
7. [More Graphics in Rust](#more-graphics-in-rust) - Incomplete

### Old School C

When working with something like the Nintendo 64, it helps to a frame of reference. As a starting point, [01-old-school-c](./examples/01-old-school-c/) provides the basic structure for a game written in C. It can be compiled with both legacy and modern SDKs, and includes minimal 3D graphics.

### Calling Rust from C

The next example, [02-calling-rust-from-c](./examples/02-calling-rust-from-c/), takes a small step towards using Rust, by calling Rust from C. This would allow you to write your game logic in Rust, but continue to rely on C to access SDK functionality.

### Booting from Rust

Going a step further, [03-booting-rust](./examples/03-booting-rust/) looks at how we can build an entire ROM using Rust and Cargo. This completely bypasses the Nintendo 64 SDK, and interfaces with the hardware directly. This is essentially OS development on the N64.

### Graphics in Rust

The [04-graphics-in-rust](./examples/04-graphics-in-rust) shows how Rust can be used to display simple text and full-screen images.

### Libdragon in C

This is another example that serves as a reference point. This time we use [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon), an open source alternative to the official SDK. [05-libdragon-in-c](./examples/05-libdragon-in-c/) provides a small example that shows how Libdragon works in C.

### Libdragon in Rust

**NOTE: This example is incomplete.**

The aim of the next example, [06-libdragon-in-rust](./examples/06-libdragon-in-rust/), is to show how we can use Libdragon from Rust, using Rust bindings to the Libdragon library.

### More Graphics In Rust

**NOTE: This example is incomplete.**

The aim of the final example is to show how Rust can be used for 3D graphics.

## Tools

1. [Texture Converter](#texture-converter)

### Texture Converter

This repo includes a small Rust program for converting images from PNG to RGBA5551 format, appropriate for loading into textures and directly into the N64 framebuffer memory. This can be used to convert images for use with [Example 04](./examples/04-graphics-in-rust).

The source code can be found in [tools/texture-converter](tools/texture-converter/).

See the README in that directory contains instructions to build and use the texture converter tool.

## Notes

Various notes about Nintendo 64 architecture and development can be found in the [notes](./notes) directory.

**Interesting N64-related repositories on GitHub**

* [Libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon)
  * Libdragon is an open-source SDK for Nintendo 64
  * `trunk` is stable code
  * `unstable` contains many new features such as OpenGL 1.1 support
    * Not well-supported by emulators at this stage
  * Not always supported by emalators, due to issues with high level emulation
    * `spritemap` example at least runs on cen64 and real hardware, so that makes it possible to make a playable game
* [asterois64](https://github.com/tristanpenman/asteroids64)
  * This is my clone of Asteroids for the Nintendo 64, written in C
  * Uses official SDK
  * Compiles using legacy and modern toolchains
